# Introduction
# Project Overview
The Library Management System (LMS) is a Java-based desktop application that streamlines the management of library operations such as book cataloging, user registration, and borrowing processes. It provides a structured solution to replace traditional manual systems, reducing errors, saving time, and improving record-keeping efficiency. The system supports two main user roles: administrators, who can add or remove books and view the list of registered users, and regular users, who can register, log in, and browse the book collection. Designed for small to medium-sized libraries, academic institutions, or community reading centers, this project offers an intuitive interface and serves as a foundation for potential future enhancements like online book reservations, overdue fine tracking, or integration with external APIs for book data.

# Commercial Value
# Potential Real-World Use
Schools and community libraries can adopt LMS to digitize their daily operations.
Reduces administrative workload by automating inventory and user management.
Can be easily extended to cloud hosting for online access.

# Third-Party Integration Possibilities

# Security
Currently uses simple role-based access control (RBAC) at frontend level.
For future enhancements, consider:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless API security.
OAuth 2.0 for third-party authentication.
Password hashing using PHP password_hash().
